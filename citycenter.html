<p>The Coliseum of Bahdahbok was used for entertainment. People played sports and came together in unity. The poor and the rich dropped their differences and came together to watch sporting events. Sometimes, people like vendors would sell their goods there and make a large profit.

<p>The center of our civilization is the Temple of Badah.  In this temple, religious leaders live and people from all over the civilization come to pray.  The temple is the center of the entire civilization because the civilization is a theocracy, so the religious leaders run the whole civilization and govern it using the words of the Book of Badah.  Beside the temple of Badah is the Coliseum of Badah, which serves as entertainment for the poor and a monument for the entire civilization; a structure that is the face of the society and is visited by peoples from many neighboring civilizations.  This monument is extremely significant because it takes the poor peopleâ€™s thoughts off of the fact that they can barely afford food.
